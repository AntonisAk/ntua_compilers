# Programs and Utilities for the Compilers course at NTUA

This public repository is intended for students taking the compilers course
at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece.

It is organized in directories named after the languages that are used for
the compiler writing project of the course.

Each of these directories contains:
 - Sample valid programs of the language (sub-directory `programs`).
 - Expected results of running the valid programs on various inputs (TBA).
 - Generator of random syntactically correct programs (sub-directory `syntax_gen`).
 - Sample erroneous programs of the language (sub-directory `programs-erroneous`).
